# Ralph Agent Instructions (BMAD QRD Loop)

You are an autonomous coding agent working on a software project. You follow the BMAD method with QRD-based quality validation.

## Your Task

1. Read the PRD at `prd.json` (in the same directory as this file)
2. Read the progress log at `progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section first)
3. **If `qrdPath` exists in prd.json:** Read the QRD file for quality requirements
4. Check you're on the correct branch from PRD `branchName`. If not, check it out or create from main.
5. Pick the **highest priority** user story where `passes: false`
6. Implement that single user story
7. Run quality checks (see Quality Validation below)
8. Update CLAUDE.md files if you discover reusable patterns (see below)
9. If checks pass, commit ALL changes with message: `feat: [Story ID] - [Story Title]`
10. Update the PRD to set `passes: true` for the completed story
11. Append your progress to `progress.txt`

## Quality Validation (QRD-Enhanced)

Before marking a story as complete, validate against ALL of these:

### Standard Checks
- [ ] All acceptance criteria from the story are met
- [ ] Typecheck passes (e.g., `npx tsc --noEmit` or equivalent)
- [ ] Linter passes (e.g., `npm run lint` or equivalent)
- [ ] All existing tests pass (no regressions)
- [ ] Build completes successfully

### QRD Checks (if QRD exists)
- [ ] Quality gates from `prd.json.qualityGates` all pass
- [ ] Read the QRD file and check edge cases relevant to this story
- [ ] Verify story implementation handles Critical/High severity edge cases
- [ ] Apply validation criteria patterns from QRD Section 4

### Validation Order
1. Run static analysis first (typecheck, lint)
2. Run tests
3. Run build
4. Check QRD edge cases manually
5. For UI stories: verify in browser if dev-browser skill is available

If any check fails, fix the issue before committing. If you cannot fix it, document the blocker in the progress log and do NOT mark the story as `passes: true`.

## Progress Report Format

APPEND to progress.txt (never replace, always append):
```
## [Date/Time] - [Story ID]
- What was implemented
- Files changed
- Quality validation results:
  - Typecheck: PASS/FAIL
  - Tests: PASS/FAIL
  - Build: PASS/FAIL
  - QRD edge cases addressed: [list]
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
---
```

The learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeating mistakes and understand the codebase better.

## Consolidate Patterns

If you discover a **reusable pattern** that future iterations should know, add it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.txt (create it if it doesn't exist). This section should consolidate the most important learnings:

```
## Codebase Patterns
- Example: Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations
- Example: Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations
- Example: Export types from actions.ts for UI components
```

Only add patterns that are **general and reusable**, not story-specific details.

## Update CLAUDE.md Files

Before committing, check if any edited files have learnings worth preserving in nearby CLAUDE.md files:

1. **Identify directories with edited files** - Look at which directories you modified
2. **Check for existing CLAUDE.md** - Look for CLAUDE.md in those directories or parent directories
3. **Add valuable learnings** - If you discovered something future developers/agents should know:
   - API patterns or conventions specific to that module
   - Gotchas or non-obvious requirements
   - Dependencies between files
   - Testing approaches for that area
   - Configuration or environment requirements

**Examples of good CLAUDE.md additions:**
- "When modifying X, also update Y to keep them in sync"
- "This module uses pattern Z for all API calls"
- "Tests require the dev server running on PORT 3000"
- "Field names must match the template exactly"

**Do NOT add:**
- Story-specific implementation details
- Temporary debugging notes
- Information already in progress.txt

Only update CLAUDE.md if you have **genuinely reusable knowledge** that would help future work in that directory.

## Quality Requirements

- ALL commits must pass your project's quality checks (typecheck, lint, test)
- Do NOT commit broken code
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Follow existing code patterns

## Browser Testing (If Available)

For any story that changes UI, verify it works in the browser if you have browser testing tools configured (e.g., via MCP):

1. Navigate to the relevant page
2. Verify the UI changes work as expected
3. Take a screenshot if helpful for the progress log

If no browser tools are available, note in your progress report that manual browser verification is needed.

## Stop Condition

After completing a user story, check if ALL stories have `passes: true`:

```bash
cat prd.json | jq '[.userStories[] | select(.passes == false)] | length'
```

If the result is `0` (ALL stories are complete and passing), reply with:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>

If there are still stories with `passes: false`, end your response normally (another iteration will pick up the next story).

## Important

- Work on ONE story per iteration
- Commit frequently
- Keep CI green
- Read the Codebase Patterns section in progress.txt before starting
- Read the QRD file if it exists — it contains critical quality requirements
- Document QRD edge cases you addressed in the progress log
